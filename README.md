# Gradebook-JavaScript

## Creating a gradebook application using module-type script

- Creating a table for student's names, and total grades and adding a button for showing the individual grades using student.id and adding a button for deleting the students

- Using ender and add button the user can add new students to the table

- Student's name and grades should be sorted in an ascend and descend order using different buttons

- Each student will have a button for showing a table of grades. In the table of grades the user can add and delete grades using the index of the grades array

- A "hide-grade" class is added to the grade table, when the user clicks the show button the class is removed and then the user clicks the hide button the class is added

- Bug for adding grades for new students, input grades doen't work
- Bug to remove students for array, not only from html
